                                <h3>Overview</h3> <p>
                              
                                <p> 
Surveys have shown that almost 45% of women are afraid to walk alone at night even for shorter distances. This type of a
fear of safety is not specific to women -- many men and elderly people also feel the same way. Studies have also shown
that physically dangerous situations often develop suddenly and unexpectedly.  While security in general has improved on
University and Corporate campuses, it is still not possible to have an escort or a companion at all times. Through this
research project, we ask the question of whether we can use a smartphone as an intelligent safety escort to solve this problem
effectively.
                                </p>

<p>
The idea of Safely was created when we observed many situations where a "smarter" phone could have saved a person's life
or gotten help much earlier. This led to the research on where the smartphone technology is today and what would it take
for smartphones to realize this bigger vision.</p>

<p>
In today’s always-connected world, we carry mobile phones and wearables such as smart watches with us at all times.
These devices have grown in their ability to sense and understand the environment around them. Today, these devices have
advanced sensors such as high precision accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, two-sided cameras and multiple
microphones to get a multi-dimensional understanding of their environment. These sensors have gotten better over the
last few years in their accuracy and power consumption characteristics. Along with this, there has been a lot of recent
breakthrough in areas such as Deep Learning which have resulted in improved pattern recognition on multi-dimensional and
diverse kinds of data. These models also have an ability to run on today’s smartphones in a battery-efficient manner.
</p>

<p> 
Through this project, we explore the idea of using our own smartphone as an always-on safety escort. We have built an Android
app called “Safely” as a prototype for this idea. Through this prototype, we investigate whether the confluence of
technological development on smartphones sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has reached a tipping point where we
can build reliable, always-on smartphone-based security agents that assist the user at each and every moment of their
lives.  </p>

								<h4>Safely as a platform</h4>
								<p>
                               
Safely uses the sensor data on the phone, combined with a deep neural network running on the SensorHub. This allows it
to run inferencing even when the Application Processor (AP) is off. Thus, Safely can run all the time even when the
phone is off and consumes negligible battery power. This can be helpful in emergency situations whether it is at home,
when on a ride, a hike, at work or at an event. </p>

                                <p>
Safely can also work in a "group" mode where it understands that a group of people are important. Examples include tour
groups, kids in a class, group of people on a hike, etc. The context of such events can be useful in determining how
Safley responds to the situation. For example, if a group of people have wandered too far, Safely can (1) reduce battery
consumption by turning off unnecessary apps to ensure connectivity for as long as possible, (2) use a peer-peer network
to extend connectivity and boost signal to any nearby cellular network. These innovations can also be helpful in a
disaster scenario such as when people are stuck in an earthquake or a fire situation.
