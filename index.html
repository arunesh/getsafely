                                Smartphones only capture Wifi and bluetooth scans and do not transmit anything. They

								<h2>Safely uses Sensors + AI to <br />
								estimate physical distance.</h2>
								<p>
                                Deep neural networks trained over fingerprint data can estimate physical distance
                                between two smartphones to under 6 feet. This can be done offline. The collected data is
                                anonymized and protected using cryptographically signed certificates. By running the
                                inferencing on the phones, we lower the power consumption.

                                Android and iOS phone SensorHub can run a Deep neural networks for background detection of anomalous
                                patterns. Such Smart algorithms designed by top developers can help identify anamalous
                                behavior patterns automatically. SensorHub's low power consumption allow inferencing to run all the time with negligible
                                battery drain.

								<p>Depending on the installation, Safely can integrate with various security systems for

								<h2>Safely as a platform for personal safety and well being.</h2>
								<p>Safely is primarily a voice-based AI assistant on the phone. Safely is always aware
                                of the user's location and context. It looks for any deviations in regular patterns and
                                combines this with inferencing from AI/Deep learning algorithms to make a judgement.<br
                                /> Below are some examples of scenarios where Safely as a platform can really add value.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-home">
									<h3>Safely at multifamily dwellings</h3>
									<p>Safely can be used for contact tracing in multifamily dwellings such as
                                    apartment buildings, condominiums, nursing homes, etc. Using the Safely platfom and
                                    SDK, a custom app can be created for each such living environment. This can help
                                    with understanding the social graph and digital contact tracing with full privacy.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-laptop">
									<h3>Safely at cruise ships</h3>
									<p>
                                    Safely can be used to integrate contact tracing in a Cruise ship's smartphone app.
                                    This can help rapid contact tracing and reduce any quarantine time.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-dumbbell">
									<h3>Safely for sports</h3>
									<p>Safely SDK can be integrated into sports apps so that they can help with contact
                                    tracing after the event.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-calendar">
									<h3>Safely for events</h3>
									<p>Special events, such as bus tours, parties, special events etc can have modules
                                    that cater to their unique characteristics. Safely can integrate with the event
                                    organizer's system for notifications and alerts.</p>
								</li>
                                <!--
								<li class="icon fa-heart">
									<h3>Safely for outdoors</h3>
									<p>As an example, in the situation of a group-hike or exercise-groups, Safely can monitor the relative
                                    location of the group of people and notify the Park authority if something unusual
                                    happens.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-taxi">
									<h3>Safely for ride-shares</h3>
									<p>Ridesharing apps can use the Safely SDK to record physical separation data,
                                     and duration. This can be used for safe and private contact tracing upon proper
                                     consent from the concerned users. This can help open-up the ride-sharing economy
                                     faster.</p>
